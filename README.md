# Book store (clean architecture example)

This is an C# example of clean software architecture for purely educational
purposes. It follows the doctrine of Uncle Bob's book "Clean Architecture - A
Craftman's Guide to Software Structure and Design".

The codebase includes multiple examples of a simple book store with few use
cases. Each example has identical functionality, but the code is structured
differently to show the trade-offs they have. Each example has an README file,
which clarifies these trade-offs.
